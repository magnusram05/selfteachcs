Lecture-1: [Functional programming in Scheme](https://archive.org/details/ucberkeley_webcast_l28HAzKy0N8)

* Learnt about a new language called Scheme. Professor Harvey was executing a bunch of Scheme programs.
Example: When executed, this (+ 3 4) will print 7

+ is the function
3 4 are actual arguments

* Prof. explained a fun program called pigl which is a code language used by children to talk infront of their parents

scheme ==> emesch - stop at the first vowel in a word and move all preceeding letters to the last!

Lecture-2: [Functional programming - Lecture-2](https://archive.org/details/ucberkeley_webcast_TTK2lZoWbPQ)

* What is a Function?
-  For one or more input, a function always returns the same output irrespective of what is happening elsewhere in the program
-  This is important in parallelism as we don't want one part of the program affecting other part
-  With multi-core processors each core can run a program simultaneously
-  A single-core can be made to run faster only so much because it wil heatup and melt after a point
-  Hence processor speeds are kept the same but no of processors increased in a computer

* Abstraction
- Application | High-level language (Scheme) | Low-level language (c) | Machine language/Architecture | Logic Gates | Transistors | Quantum Physics
- Abstraction is a layer built on top of lower-level bulding blocks
