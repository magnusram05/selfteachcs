# selfteachcs

Found this guide today (22-Mar-2025) https://teachyourselfcs.com/ - a guide I have been looking for so long now - one that matches my criteria 100%. 
What was I looking for? - I was looking for advice on how to learn CS as an engineer who did not come from CS background but have got years of Software Engineering professional experience.  

Hopefully I have found 'the' roadmap for my journey into learing CS.
